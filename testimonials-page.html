			<blockquote>Lawfirm was our Lawyer after our daughter died. We were awarded $5.9 million dollars. Lawfirm studied our daughter's illness and became as knowledgeable as any medical professional. Lawfirm is more than a lawyer - he is a man who cares. We think of him as a friend first and a lawyer second. Law Firm really cares.<br>

			<blockquote>Law Firm gave me my life back, literally. He was able to assist me with my disability and handled my medical malpractice case with honesty and integrity.It doesn&rsquo;t replace the loss of a foot but it made the transition in my life easier. It also helped me find my faith. He is honest and upstanding.<br>

			<blockquote>Law Firm was there for my family when we needed him most. He was a pro all the way, answering our questions, listening to us and helping us through the horrible injuries suffered by our son. He became and remains our friend; I cannot imagine working with any other attorney.<br>

			<blockquote>My husband and I would like to thank you and Lindsey and your law firm for everything you all did during our time with you. Thank you for always being willing to go over Hunter&rsquo;s case with us numerous times, when we were not quite understanding exactly what was going on. Thank you for never making us feel stupid when we did have questions. Even though this was not a situation we wished our son to go through, I think God had a plan to bring you all into our lives to fight hard for him and get the best possible for him. Before all of this occurred we had no idea where to turn to, to get the right help. I think we may have been taken advantage of if it were not for your law firm. I&#39;m sorry to go on, but we just can&#39;t say enough to you all! Thank you also to your office staff, no matter which office I called they were always friendly and always very willing to help us out!! Mr. Friedel if you could please pass along our thank you to everyone involved. Please let Lindsey know we know she took a lot of time and worked very hard for us and we deeply appreciate all she had done! God forbid we should ever need attorneys again, you can bet we will be coming in your direction. I will tell anyone who ever asks if I know anyone good where to go! Thank you so very very much for your hard work and great kindness to our family! Thank you<br>

			<blockquote>Lindsay Rakers is an outstanding attorney who puts people over money. Before taking on our case, she advised that if her services would not be necessary in obtaining the outcome favorable for my family, she would not take a fee.<br>
				<br>
				Finding someone like Lindsay is very rare in today&rsquo;s society and especially someone practicing law. With her, there will never be a doubt in mind that she has your best interest in mind. I would recommend her to anyone at a crossroad after suffering a personal injury.<br>

			<blockquote>Thank you for providing me your service with my recent uninsured auto accident and for working with gathering information from the other insurance companies. Although my injuries turned out to be soft tissue with no permanent damage, I am truly thankful for your help.<br>
				<br>
				Having your professional assistance with dealing with the other two drivers and their insurance companies really helped take the stress out of this ordeal. I really appreciated your outstanding, courteous help by always being available and your quick response to questions I asked regarding this case. It is very refreshing knowing there are very high caliber lawyers like yourself helping the average person like me.<br>

			<blockquote>I think the world of Lawfirm. He is like family to me. He is a fantastic attorney and was relentless in his pursuit to find the truth. Thanks to Lawfirm my life drastically changed for the better. I highly recommend Law Firm to anyone in need of an honest hardworking attorney that can get the job done and find your closure. Lawfirm walked me through the entire process step by step and took the weight of the world off my shoulders. I can't say enough....<br>

			<blockquote>My family and I are involved in an ongoing case with Lawfirm. When I first met Lawfirm I was an emotional wreck &ndash; and he soon became my damage control. I drove to his office on a Saturday to meet with him for the first time. He could not have been nicer. I could not believe he would meet with new clients on a Saturday.<br>
				<br>
				He took his time explaining everything to me - he was down to earth. Lawfirm is straight forward, pleasant, very understanding and humble. I would put him on a pedestal right now. Lawfirm is very hard-working and he has a great team as well. They go above and beyond. I really appreciate everything.<br>

			<blockquote>When I got hurt, I almost lost everything. Law Firm was there for me and helped me put my life together. I drove a truck for a living. Lawfirm always explained my case, told me what was going on and spent the time to make sure I understood my rights. I tell all my family and any friend who ask: CALL Lawfirm, he will help you.<br>

			<blockquote>Thank you for all of your hard and honest work. You made this not-so-good experience work out in my favor. I know my case was complicated, but you did not give up. You made me feel comfortable all the way to the end. I will always be grateful and would recommend you to anyone, Attorney Rakers!<br>

			<blockquote>My name is, Norman B., Makishia&#39;s husband. She informed me you helped her during the time I had my accident. I want to thank you greatly for all that you did for us during that time. You came highly recommended to us from very trustworthy friends because of your excellent business ethics and care that you have for your clients. I am very pleased to know there is someone as reliable and trustworthy as yourself to work with in the world today. I just wanted to contact you to extend my gratitude and say THANK YOU for all that you do.<br>

			<blockquote>Thank you so much for the efficient, professional and very effective manner you handled my personal injury case. My exposure to legal proceedings has been, fortunately, limited in my lifetime.
				Should I need assistance in the future, you will be the first attorney I call.<br>

			<blockquote>Lindsay was very professional and understanding to all my issues. I would say if you&rsquo;re looking for a good attorney that will work for you and get you the very best results, it&rsquo;s Lindsay. I would hire her again. It&rsquo;s one thing to hire someone who just cares about winning the case, but she cared about my pains and issues as well. It wasn&rsquo;t just about money. She always kept me informed with what was happening with my case.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks again Lindsay, may God bless you.<br>
